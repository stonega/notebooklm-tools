# Animations Guidelines
 
Use `motion/react` for animations.

## Keep your animations fast
 
- Default to use `spring` for most animations.
- Animations should never be longer than 1s (unless it's illustrative), most of them should be around 0.2s to 0.3s.
 
 
## Hover transitions
 
- Use the built-in CSS `ease` with a duration of `200ms` for simple hover transitions like `color`, `background-color`,`opacity`.
- Fall back to easing rules for more complex hover transitions.
- Disable hover transitions on touch devices with the `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` media query.
 
## Accessibility
 
- If `transform` is used in the animation, disable it in the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
 
## Origin-aware animations
 
- Elements should animate from the trigger. If you open a dropdown or a popover it should animate from the button. Change `transform-origin` according to the trigger position.
 
## Performance
 
- Stick to opacity and transforms when possible. Example: Animate using `transform` instead of `top`, `left`, etc. when trying to move an element.
- Do not animate drag gestures using CSS variables.
- Do not animate blur values higher than 20px.
- Use `will-change` to optimize your animation, but use it only for: `transform`, `opacity`, `clipPath`, `filter`.
- When using Motion/Framer Motion use `transform` instead of `x` or `y` if you need animations to be hardware accelerated.
 
## Spring animations
 
- Default to spring animations when using Framer Motion.
- Avoid using bouncy spring animations unless you are working with drag gestures.
